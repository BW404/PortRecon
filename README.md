## Overview

PortRecon is a specialized reconnaissance tool that performs a two-stage discovery process:

1. **Stage 1 (Network Scanning)**: Scans a large number of IP addresses across multiple ranges for open ports (specifically port 11434, which is the default Ollama port)
2. **Stage 2 (Service Verification)**: Verifies that open ports are actually running Ollama by sending HTTP requests to validate the service

This approach is significantly faster and more efficient than traditional vulnerability scanning across large IP ranges.

## Features

- ✅ **Bulk IP Range Scanning**: Scan multiple IP ranges simultaneously using Nmap
- ✅ **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded execution for maximum performance (24 concurrent workers)
- ✅ **Service Verification**: HTTP-based validation to confirm Ollama service instances
- ✅ **Resume Capability**: Automatically saves progress and can resume interrupted scans
- ✅ **CSV Output**: Results saved in easy-to-parse CSV format
- ✅ **SSL/HTTPS Support**: Handles both HTTP and HTTPS connections
- ✅ **Thread-Safe Operations**: Safe concurrent access to output files
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators with ETA calculations

## Requirements

Before running PortRecon, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.7+** installed
- **Nmap** command-line tool installed on your system
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install nmap`
  - macOS: `brew install nmap`
  - Windows: Download from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/download.html)
- **Required Python packages** (see Installation)

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the repository:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/PortRecon
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install:
   - `requests>=2.31.0` - For HTTP requests
   - `python-nmap` - Python wrapper for Nmap

3. **Verify Nmap installation:**
   ```bash
   nmap --version
   ```

```

## Configuration

### Input Format (data.json)

Create a `data.json` file in the project directory with your IP ranges:

```json
[
  {
    "start": "10.2.160.0",
    "end": "10.2.167.255"
  },
  {
    "start": "10.38.238.0",
    "end": "10.38.238.255"
  }
]
```

**Note**: You can use the provided `sample-input.json` as a template.

### Scanner Configuration

Edit `1. scanner.py` to adjust:

```python
PORTS = "11434"           # Port to scan (Ollama default)
MAX_WORKERS = 24          # Concurrent scan threads
RETRIES = 3               # Retry attempts per target
```

### Ollama Checker Configuration

Edit `2.ollama-checker.py` to adjust:

```python
TIMEOUT = 5               # HTTP request timeout (seconds)
MAX_WORKERS = 8           # Concurrent HTTP request threads
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Prepare Input Data

Create a `data.json` file with your target IP ranges. You can copy and modify the `sample-input.json`:

```bash
cp sample-input.json data.json
# Edit data.json with your target IP ranges
```

Example:
```json
[
  {
    "start": "192.168.1.0",
    "end": "192.168.1.255"
  },
  {
    "start": "10.0.0.0",
    "end": "10.0.0.255"
  }
]
```

### Step 2: Run Network Scanner

The first stage scans all IP ranges for open ports:

```bash
python "1. scanner.py"
```

**What it does:**
- Reads IP ranges from `data.json`
- Scans all hosts in those ranges for port 11434
- Saves results to `nmap_results.csv`
- Saves progress to `state.json` for resume capability

**Expected output:**
```
Progress: 2048/2048 (100.00%), ETA: 0s
Scan completed.
```

**Output file (`nmap_results.csv`):**
```
Host,Open Ports
10.2.160.5,11434
10.2.160.127,11434
10.38.238.45,11434
...
```

### Step 3: Run Ollama Checker

The second stage verifies that found ports are actually running Ollama:

```bash
python 2.ollama-checker.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads hosts with open ports from `nmap_results.csv`
- Sends HTTP requests to verify Ollama service
- Saves confirmed Ollama hosts to `ollama.csv`
- Saves progress to `ollama-state.json`

**Expected output:**
```
[████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 67.5% (27/40) | Found: 8
✓ Found 8/40 hosts with Ollama running
Results saved to ollama.csv
```

**Output file (`ollama.csv`):**
```
Host,Open Ports
10.2.160.5,11434
10.2.160.127,11434
10.38.238.45,11434
```

### Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Prepare your configuration
nano data.json

# 2. Run Stage 1: Network Scanning
python "1. scanner.py"

# 3. Check intermediate results (optional)
head -20 nmap_results.csv

# 4. Run Stage 2: Ollama Verification
python 2.ollama-checker.py

# 5. View final results
cat ollama.csv
```

## Output Files

| File | Purpose | Created By |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `nmap_results.csv` | All hosts with open port 11434 | `1. scanner.py` |
| `ollama.csv` | Verified Ollama service hosts | `2.ollama-checker.py` |
| `state.json` | Scanner progress checkpoint | `1. scanner.py` |
| `ollama-state.json` | Ollama checker progress checkpoint | `2.ollama-checker.py` |

## Resume & Recovery

Both tools support resuming interrupted scans:

### Network Scanner Resume
If `1. scanner.py` is interrupted:
```bash
python "1. scanner.py"  # Automatically resumes from last checkpoint
```

Progress is saved in `state.json` every 10 scans or at completion.

### Ollama Checker Resume
If `2.ollama-checker.py` is interrupted:
```bash
python 2.ollama-checker.py  # Automatically resumes from last checkpoint
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to pause gracefully. Progress is automatically saved.

### Manual Recovery
To start fresh (deleting all progress):
```bash
rm state.json ollama-state.json nmap_results.csv ollama.csv
python "1. scanner.py"
python 2.ollama-checker.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "nmap_results.csv not found"
**Solution**: Make sure `1. scanner.py` completed successfully before running `2.ollama-checker.py`

### Issue: "No hosts found" after scanning
**Possible causes**:
- IP ranges are incorrect or unreachable
- Firewall blocking port 11434
- No Ollama services running in the range
- Check with manual nmap: `nmap -Pn -p 11434 <target>`

### Issue: Slow scanning
**Solutions**:
- Increase `MAX_WORKERS` in `1. scanner.py` (up to 32-48 for large ranges)
- Ensure adequate network bandwidth
- Check if firewall is throttling connections

### Issue: SSL/Certificate errors
**Note**: `2.ollama-checker.py` automatically ignores SSL warnings. If you see warnings, they are suppressed and can be ignored.

### Issue: Permission denied (Linux/Mac)
**Solution**: 
```bash
chmod +x "1. scanner.py" "2.ollama-checker.py"
```

## Performance Tips

- **For large IP ranges (10,000+ hosts)**: Increase `MAX_WORKERS` to 32-48 in `scanner.py`
- **For slow networks**: Increase `RETRIES` and `timeout` values
- **For better accuracy**: Run `2.ollama-checker.py` twice if results seem incomplete
- **Memory optimization**: Process one target range at a time for very large scans
